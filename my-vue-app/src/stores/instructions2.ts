  101: `• Describe the molecular mechanism of the selected intervention.`,
  102: `• Indicate whether the expected remission efficiency of the designated intervention according to your research data is approximately 80%.`,
  103: `• Provide any reported remission efficacy of the intervention.`,
  104: `• Provide evidence suggesting that the selected treatment/intervention is effective across all clinical types of the disease—supporting the hypothesis that these types share a common molecular pathway, and differ only by initial triggers(s).`,
  105: `• Evaluate whether the response time of the intervention is significantly shorter than the natural resolution time.`,
  201: `• Before answering, refer to the glossary on “Molecular Stages” and “Molecular Types.” If more than one cell type contributes to disease development, consider whether their involvement reflects a disease progression (molecular stages), a trigger-specific differentiation (molecular types), or neither.`,
  202: `• Refer to the answer from A-4. Please state the diagnostic criteria used for the studied disease. If the chosen intervention from publications or reports is likely to induce remission, you may also state those reported diagnostic criteria.`,
  203: `• If the disease involves both molecular stages and types (see B-1), do any contradictions exist in their natural courses? For example, do some lesions appear self-limiting while others are progressive? If such contradictions exist, consider whether the disease should be separated into distinct conditions and revise your answers accordingly.`,
  204: `• Please assess whether the remission criteria for this disease are clearly defined—either clinically, molecularly, or both. Refer to the glossary entry for “Remission.”

Select one:
◻ Yes — Both molecular and clinical remission criteria are clearly defined
◻ Yes — Clinical remission is defined, but molecular remission remains uncertain
    If Yes Please also provide the remission criteria, if a disease is diagnosed based on two diagnostic criteria, the remission criteria must be parallel to these diagnostic criteria. This means remission is achieved only when both of the same criteria used for diagnosis are no longer met, as determined by the same methods and thresholds applied during diagnosis.
◻ No — Remission criteria are not clearly defined
◻ Not possible to achieve remission-- the disease can only be managed symptomatically, without the possibility of achieving true remission (see Glossary: Remission).`,
  205: `• Please indicate whether a natural endpoint timeframe for the disease is known. This refers to the typical time it takes for the disease to reach resolution or plateau without intervention. Understanding this timeframe is essential for determining whether a remission is stable and exceeds the disease’s natural course (see Glossary: Remission).`,
  206: `• Review the glossary. If the molecular cascade matches all diagnostic criteria, select “completed” and briefly explain the molecular mechanism. You may select multiple options if endocrine pathways are involved; otherwise, select only one.`,
  207: `• Multiple mechanisms may be selected corresponding to symptoms and signs of the designated disease.`
